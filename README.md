# MVA Project: The Tuned Lens

To run the notebook in the `prompting` folder, create a .env file at the root of this repository for your HuggingFace token. You will need an access to Llama-3 in order to run the notebook.

Then you have to install our debugged version of the `tuned-lens` library. From the `tuned-lens` folder of this repository, do:
```
pip install .
```
